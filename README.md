# hello-world
just another hello-world repository

In a Fundamental Data Analytics course at my university, we are asked to do a Data Analytics Project at websites like Kaggle. Unfortunately, we as non-informatics students, have little to no promgramma/coding skills. Soon after completing the Excel tutorials (we are good with that!), we started with the alternative Python assignment. We followed the tutorial carefully, but we faced difficulties already in the first few paragraphs. For example when instructed to instal python, we got the link and the version, but when inputting the codes, we were reminded that we need to install certain packages too. After some trial and error, we decided to install a more comprehensive version of Python: The "comprehensive" package "Anaconda", that installs Pythons and 120+ commonnly used packages. 

Finally we started coding, and we ran into coding challenges. For example, the differences in rb and wb plus a number of syntax erros, some were solvable by Googling, some were not. Eventually, we got stuck at "Reading the test data and writing the model as a csv". I guess we were missing out on some key coding principles or some unknown mathematical assumptions / axioms. 

In between Googling, we found iPython Jupyter Notebook, it claims to work interactively in the browsers, is also webbased and that is it far more "competitive" while being more accessible for newcomers.  

Hence my first GitHub!
