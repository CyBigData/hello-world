# hello-world
just another hello-world repository

Came across various Githubs project sites in the past, but never started or had done any projects with it, because nobody in the my environmnent is doing that. 

In a Fundamental Data Analytics course at my university, we are asked to do a Data Analytics Project at websites like Kaggle. Unfortunately, we as non-informatics students, have little to no promgramma/coding skills. Soon after completing the Excel tutorials (we are good with that!), we started with the alternative Python assignment. We followed the tutorial carefully, but we faced difficulties already in the first few paragraphs. Somehow the assumption here was that we never installed Python, but that we are fully aware of how to install library/packages f√≥r Python. For example when instructed to instal python, we got the link and the version, but when inputting the codes, we were reminded that we need to install certain packages too.

After failing to install numpy, we decided to install a more comprehensive version of Python: The "comprehensive" package "Anaconda", that installs Pythons and 120+ common used packages for us. 

Finally we started coding, however, it seems that are more assumptions between the coding lines. For example, the differences in rb and wb plus a number of syntax erros, some were solvable by Googling, some were not. Eventually, we got stuck at "Reading the test data and writing the gender model as a csv"

In between Googling, we found iPython Notebook, it claims to work interactively in the browsers and that is it far more "competitive", but still or even more accessible for newcomers. 

Hence my first GitHub!
